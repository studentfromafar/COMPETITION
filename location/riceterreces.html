          <p class="description">
            The Banaue Rice Terraces are among the Philippines' top tourist
            destinations.<br />
            Called the 8th Wonder of the Modern World by locals,Â these terraces
            are said to have been carved <br />
            into the mountains and hillsides by the ancestors of the local
            indigenous <br />
            Ifugao tribes, and are well over 2,000 years old.
